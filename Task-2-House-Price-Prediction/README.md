## Task 2: House Price Prediction

### Domain
Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning

### Objective
To predict house prices based on numerical features using machine learning regression techniques.

### Dataset
- BostonHousing.csv
- Contains features like RM, LSTAT, PTRATIO, TAX, etc.

### Algorithm Used
- Linear Regression

### Steps Performed
1. Imported required libraries
2. Loaded and explored the dataset
3. Performed train-test split
4. Trained Linear Regression model
5. Evaluated model performance

### Evaluation Metrics
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- R² Score

### Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Google Colab

### Outcome
The model successfully predicts house prices with reasonable accuracy using regression techniques.
## How to Run
1. Open `house_price_prediction.ipynb`
2. Ensure `BostonHousing.csv` is in the same folder
3. Run all cells to train and evaluate the model
4. ## Future Improvements
- Try advanced regression models
- Apply feature scaling
- Perform hyperparameter tuning
- ## Data Split
The dataset was split into training and testing sets to evaluate model performance.
